# processingOctober2021
a place to cold some processing sketches I made while in the office

## ravenWordsp uses the ttslib https://www.local-guru.net/blog/pages/ttslib

ravenWordsp does not work in processing 4, because of the library, but i will work with processing 3

## ravenWord dosen't have tts

## sol LeWitt and wall draw

>“On a wall surface, any
 continuous stretch of wall,
 using a hard pencil, place
 fifty points at random.
 The points should be evenly
 distributed over the area
 of the wall. All of the
 points should be connected
 by straight lines. “ -Wall drawing 118
 
 >A complete graph also called a Full Graph
 it is a graph that has n vertices where
 the degree of each vertex is n-1.
 In other words, each vertex is connected with
 every other vertex.

 >Now, you have n vertices in total,
 so you might be tempted to say that there are
 n(n−1) edges in total, n−1 for every vertex in
 your graph. But this method counts every edge twice,
 because every edge going out from one
 vertex is an edge going into another vertex.
 Hence, you have to divide your result by 2.
 This leaves you with n(n−1)/2.
 
 
 ## polarDrift 
 
 is a modular mult. line art with simple polar coordinates.
 You can click around to get differnt multiples and points on the circle
 if theta gets high it starts to get out of phase and drift

 ## Digital Harmony sketches are playing with sine waves to look like Whitney's digital harmony
 the waves are drawn with no loops, one loop and two loops and either scroll or not
